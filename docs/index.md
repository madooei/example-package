## What is `example-package`?

`example-package` is a minimal TypeScript package template. It is designed to demonstrate how to structure, build, test, and publish a TypeScript package in a portable and easy-to-understand way.

Currently, this package only exports a simple function and a type as an example. When you replace this with your real package code, you can expand this documentation to describe your package's features, API, and usage.
