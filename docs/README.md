# Documentation

The `guides/` directory contains student-focused guides to help understand the project setup and development practices. These guides are designed to be educational and provide detailed explanations of selected topics relevant to the project that I believe college students typically are not familiar with.

The `index.md` serves as the main entry point for usage guides for end users. It will be deployed as the main page of the documentation site (GitHub Pages).
