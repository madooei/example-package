# Roadmap for Example Package Workspace

This document outlines the roadmap for the Example Package Workspace, detailing its current status, future plans, and key decisions made during development.

## Project Overview

The Example Package Workspace is a minimal TypeScript package template designed to demonstrate best practices in package structure, build processes, testing, and documentation. It serves as a foundation for creating portable, easy-to-understand packages that can be used independently or as part of larger projects.

## Current Status

### What's Complete ‚úÖ

- **Core Package Structure**: Functional TypeScript package with dual ESM/CJS build
- **Development Tooling**: Complete toolchain (tsup, vitest, ESLint, Prettier)
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test setup with coverage and UI modes
- **Validation Pipeline**: Automated type-checking, linting, formatting, and testing
- **Documentation System**: Multi-file knowledge base with guides and technical details
- **Example Implementations**: Working examples and playground demonstrations
- **Release Workflow**: Automated versioning with standard-version

### Current Development Focus üîÑ

- **Documentation Refinement**: Improving developer experience with better knowledge organization
- **Template Usability**: Making it easier for others to adopt and customize
- **Build Optimization**: Ensuring efficient development and production workflows

### Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

- `standard-version` dependency is archived (consider migrating to `@changesets/cli`)
- Some relative path links may break when README is symlinked
- VS Code workspace configuration could be enhanced for better multi-root experience

### Next Steps üìã

- [ ] Evaluate migration from `standard-version` to modern alternatives
- [ ] Add more comprehensive examples for different use cases
- [ ] Enhance GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and publishing
- [ ] Consider adding development container setup for consistent environments
- [ ] Improve error handling and validation messages in example code

## Project Evolution

### Key Decisions Made

- **Portability over Convenience**: Chose simple monorepo structure without workspace tools to maintain package independence
- **Modern Tooling**: Selected tsup over tsc for better developer experience and dual-format builds
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Implemented strict validation pipeline to catch issues early
- **Documentation Strategy**: Created multi-file knowledge base to serve different audiences (users, developers, AI assistants)

### Learnings and Insights

- **Template Balance**: Finding the right balance between comprehensive setup and simplicity for new users
- **Tool Selection**: Modern tools like tsup and vitest provide significantly better developer experience than traditional alternatives
- **Knowledge Organization**: Separating user docs from technical details improves maintainability and reduces cognitive load
- **Symlink Strategy**: Using symlinks for unified README access while maintaining focused file purposes

### Recent Changes

- Implemented unified documentation strategy with README symlinks
- Created comprehensive DEVELOPMENT.md for technical knowledge base
- Enhanced package management workflows with detailed guides
- Improved validation pipeline with clear command structure
